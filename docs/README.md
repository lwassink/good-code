## Minimum Viable Product

Goodcode is a web application based on Goodreads but designed to support reviews of coding frameworks and librarys rather than books.
It is built using Ruby on Rails and React/Redux.
By the end of Week 9, this app will, at a minimum, satisfy the following creteria with smooth, bug free navigation, adequate seed data and sufficient CSS styling:

- [ ] Hosting on Heroku
- [ ] New account creation, login, and guest login
- [ ] Programs
- [ ] Storing programs in a personal collection
- [ ] Giving programs a status (have used/want to use/etc.)
- [ ] Review programs in markdown
- [ ] Infinite scroll or pagination for programs index
