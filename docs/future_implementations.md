# Future Implementations Plan

There are many additional features that could be added to Goodcode.
Here is a partial list.

* **Friending other users** Users could friend each other once logged-in, the home page would display a feed of a user's friends' recent reviews and added coding tools.
* **Multiple login sessions** Allow a user to log in to the same account from multiple browsers at the same time.
* **Creating new statuses** Currently when a users sets a status for a given program, they must pick from a predefined list of statuses.
This feature would allow them to create new statuses of their own and view programs having those statuses.
* Account activation emails.
* Authentication integration with Google and Facebook.
