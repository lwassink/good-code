# Cloudinary

[Cloudinary](https://www.cloudinary.com) is used to store images for the coding tool logos.
The cloudinary upload widget allows users to upload new images from their browers.
Some styling was done to bring the upload widgit more in line with goodcode styles.
There is room for more styling in the future.
